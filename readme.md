# Emission Factor Management in IBM Envizi

## Objective
The objective of this article is to help understand how Envizi manages the Emission factors  

## What are Emission Factors and why those are important

When Organization started their Sustainability journey, the very crucial thing is to start capturing the relavant data with respect to their operations to estimate / calculate the emissions. The captured data should be cleaned, normalized and then used to calculate the organization emissions. 

So to calculate emissions,  two types of input data is required. 
- activity data 
- emission factors

#### Activity data
Activity data is a quantitative measure of a level of activity that results in GHG emissions. 
This is the data the organization captures from their operations / supplychain,etc 
For example, how may liters of fuel consumed, how much electricity is consumed, how many kilograms of material purchased , etc

#### Emission factor
An emission factor is a factor that converts activity data into GHG emissions data
For example, how much  kg CO2 is emitted per liter of fuel consumed ,how much  kg CO2 is emitted for one kwh power consumption,  how much  kg CO2 emitted per kilograms of material produced, etc.

In otherwords, emission factors helps organizations to calculate the emissions or co2 equivalent of Greenhouse gases which are emitted because of the activities performed by their business. 



## Who developes the Emissions Factors 

The Governments, environmental agencies, organizations, research insitutes publishes the emission factors for numerous activity based data,  based on the scientific studies and experiements conducted considering various parameters, conditions, states , regions , etc

Below are the some of the well known emission factor sets published by various organizations and countries. 

- ***International Energy Agency (IEA)*** publishes a comprehensive set of  Electricity and Heating emission factors annually covering most countries and regions in the world. Hence this emission factor set is leverage globally when the country or region specific emission factors are not available.  [more info](https://www.google.com/)

- ***Environmental Protetction Agency (EPA)*** of United States, publishes emission factors for  electricity purchased from eGRID, mobile combustion, upstream and downstream transportation, business travel, product transport, and employee commuting.   [more info](https://www.google.com/)

- ***Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)*** and the UK Government publishes a comprehensive set of  GHG emission factors covering Scope 1, 2 and some Scope 3 emission sources. Mainly applies to UK, however company across Europe use this factor set.  [more info](https://www.google.com/)

- ***New Zealand Ministry for the Environment*** publishes GHG emission factors covering Scope 1, 2 and some Scope 3 emission sources.  [more info](https://www.google.com/)

- ***The Australian Government*** publishes GHG emission factors covering Scope 1, 2 data sources. [more info](https://www.google.com/)

- ***Eoraâ€™s MRIO (Multi-region input-output)*** provides spend-based emission factor set across 66 industry sectors, which is gloabally recognized.  [more info](https://www.google.com/)

## How Emissions Factors are applied in Envizi ?

As we learnt in the begining of the article, emissions are calculated for a given activity data  by applying the corresponding emission factor.  

### Emissions Factor selection process 

Lets say, an Organization in United States  purchases electricity from a electricity grid for their day to day operations.  
    So here, activity data = the electricity consumed  

Now, how do we find which emission factor to apply on  this activity data(consumed electricity) to calculate the emissions  ??

Typically below steps are followed :

1. Check if Emission factors are provided by Supplier / Provider
2. If not,  look for available emission factors published for the regions, country, continent and global in sequence.

When the organization has operations spread across multiple regions / continents, it will be quite tedious and error prone process to find the applicable emission factor. And also, the organization may have other crieterias to consider like whether to apply the factor based on factor publishing date or effective date. 

### Factor Selection Algorithm in Envizi

This is where Envizi brings the value by automating the process to find the appropriate factor based by applying the Factor Selection Algorithm (FSA).  

How does the Factor Set Algorithm (FSA) works ? 

Assuming the data is loaded into Accounts / meters and normalized as Monthly data, Envizi apply the factor selection algorithm (FSA) , which basically filerts through the all available factors based on the following  five criterias: 
    
- Data type : type of activity data - Electricity, Natural Gas, etc.
- Sub type : Sub categorization similar to data type to link factors to accounts
- Factor Set : Collection of emission factors 
- Region : the region where the emission factor is applicable. 4 levels are considered (city, state, country, global)
- Effective and Published Dates : organizations can apply factors by effective or published dates, depending on preference

### Factor Selection Algorithm with Example

FSA is a 5 step process which goes as below.

Now, Lets look at Emission factors applied by Envizi for various accounts associated with different locations

Example Account: ELEC_VEEE1697
Location -  NewYork, US , Data type - Electricity, Date of Activity data - Oct,2023
Applied Factor - eGrid-2023 , Effective from - Jan 2021

<img src="images/Envizi-Electricity-NY_EMF-Details.png">    


Example Account: ELEC_VEEE1697
Location -  London Center, UK , Data type - Electricity, Date of Activity data -Dec, 2022 
Applied Factor - DEFRA-2022, Effective from - Jan 2021

<img src="images/Envizi-Electricity-UK-Defra-2022.png">    


For the same Account: ELEC_VEEE1697, observe the emission factor applied for a different period of activity data

<img src="images/Envizi-Electricity-UK-Defra-2023.png">    


Take a close look at screenshots 4 & 5, although DEFRA Emission factor set applied, both are different versions.  For 2022 data, Envizi's FSA applied DEFRA-2022 because it is effective from Jan 2022-DeC 2022.  For 2023 data, new DEFRA factorset is applied which is effective from Jan 2023. You can also look at Total CO2e and Facotor source values from the screenshot. 

For keeping things easier and simpler, here we only talk about Factor Effective dates, not publishing dates. To learn more on effective and published date logic works together in Envizi, please refer https://knowledgebase.envizi.com/home/factor-published-date-logic


## How does these Emission Factor Sets are maintained in Envizi ?

Envizi product team follow the below steps to ensure factor appropriateness and correctness.

- most current and up-to-date factors are available in the system 
- ensure the data integrity by conducting  regular audits and reviews. 
- Set review dates for all factors which will be updating frequently
- make sure no factor conflicts arises as the factor sets are being updated
- create special list of factors based on the organization request
- conducts variance analysis on factors which helps to find the factors exists outside the thresholds of datatypes. 

  

# Custom Emission Factors

Envizi provides the standard set of emission factors with the platform. However, if your organization have defined custom emission factors, Envizi allows you to create the same in the platform. Once created, these custom factors are selected in preference to Envizi's default set of managed factors.

To create new Custom Factor in Envizi, navigate to  Admin -> Configuration -> Custom Factors. 
Provide the inputs for the below parameters.
- Region : Provide the City / state / region for which the Cusom factor should be applied
- Data Type : Chose the data type from the list
- Factor Set : Go with default. Nothing to update
- Name : Provide a unique name to represent the custom factor
- Total CO2e : Provide the emissions in CO2e 
- Effective from : Date from when this custom factor is applied
- Effective to : End date for the custom factor to be applied

Once created, you can view the Custom Emission Factors from the same page as Admin -> Configuration -> Custom Factors. 
    
Here is example of custom factors created in the system. In the below screenshot, you can see  custom factors created for each month for the same region and data type.

<img src="images/Envizi-CF-list.png">    


Now, lets have a look at how these factors applied in Envizi. The custom factor would be applied to an Account with data type : Natural Gas associaed with the Location : New South Wales, Australia.   

Below is the screenshot of the account's monthly data summary.   For the Month of March22, the custom factor set NSW_NG_Custom Factor-March22 is applied. You can also note the effective dates.
